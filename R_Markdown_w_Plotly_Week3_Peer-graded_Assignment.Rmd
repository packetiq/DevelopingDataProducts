## Example of a Plotly Graph on diamonds data  


__Plotly graphs are interactive__: Click-drag to zoom, shift-click to pan, double-click to autoscale  



```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(plotly)
set.seed(100)
d <- diamonds[sample(nrow(diamonds), 1000), ]
plot_ly(d, x = ~carat, y = ~price, color = ~carat,
        size = ~carat, text = ~paste("Clarity: ", clarity))

```
